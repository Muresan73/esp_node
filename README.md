# Home Garden Node with ESP32 (no_std) 🪴
## Overview

Welcome to my garden sensor node project!\
This project is primarily a playground for me learning embedded **Rust**. <img src="https://www.rustacean.net/assets/rustacean-flat-happy.svg" width=50>\
It is a continuation of my previous work on [esp_termo](https://github.com/Muresan73/esp_termo). However, this time around, I'm exploring a `no_std` approach to build a robust and resource-efficient solution for my plants' needs ( and to have some fun 🦝).

## Features

- [ ] Timer -> Daily report

Ecosistem is not mature enough, packages may require non-release repo builds and unstable apis, so I decided to come back later and finish features requring such capabilites later.
Libraries tested:
